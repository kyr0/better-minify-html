# Contributing to `better-minify-html`

Contributions are welcome here! I've limited the scope of this project to use with Node.js only,
just because I want to be able to maintain this fork (unlike the original project, which is pretty unmaintained since about a year).
If you, however, have the bandwidth/capacity to help maintaining one of the different languages, support for Java, Python, Ruby etc. can be re-added.

Install Node.js, and PNPM.
